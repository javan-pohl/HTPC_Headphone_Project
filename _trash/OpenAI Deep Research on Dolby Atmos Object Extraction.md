Great — I’ll begin researching the feasibility of extracting Dolby Atmos object metadata from local Blu-ray rips and applying that data for offline or real-time binaural rendering, ideally on consumer HTPC hardware. I’ll also explore relevant tools across both Windows and Linux platforms, with a preference for open-source or minimally licensed solutions.

I’ll get back to you with an assessment of viable approaches, community efforts, licensing risks, and technical hurdles, along with possible proof-of-concept pathways.


# Dolby Atmos Object Metadata Extraction for DIY HTPC Binaural Audio

## Background: Atmos on HTPC and Current Limitations

**Dolby Atmos Overview:** Dolby Atmos is an object-based audio format supporting up to **128 discrete audio elements** (typically 10 fixed “bed” channels + 118 audio objects) with accompanying 3D metadata. This allows sound mixers to place audio “objects” freely in a 3D space, and the Atmos **renderer** dynamically maps those objects to your speaker setup or headphones during playback. In a theater or high-end home system, Atmos can render to layouts as large as 24.1.10 (34 speakers) by intelligently distributing these objects.

**HTPC Decoding Limitation:** On a Windows HTPC today, however, we **don’t get true object-based output** from Atmos tracks. Blu-ray Atmos audio (typically TrueHD+Atmos) is decoded by software like LAV Filters into a maximum of **8 PCM channels** (7.1), essentially the 7.1 **bed** mix plus two collapsed height channels. In other words, all the rich object metadata gets **flattened down** into a conventional 7.1 mix. For example, the two height speakers in a 7.1.2 bed are often folded into the back surround channels or into a generic “top front L/R” mix. This means any distinct motion or separation of overhead sounds (front vs rear height, object movement overhead) is lost – you get only a basic up/down effect. The user’s current setup confirms this: LAV Audio Decoder yields 7.1 PCM where channels 7 and 8 carry a combined height mix (not discrete objects).

**Windows Audio Channel Limits:** Part of this bottleneck is that the standard Windows audio stack (WASAPI or DirectSound) and most media frameworks are designed around channel-based audio, **capped at 8 channels (7.1)** in many cases. Consumer sound cards, HDMI audio drivers, etc., typically expose at most 8 channels to the OS. So even if more Atmos channels could be decoded, the OS can’t directly handle them without special spatial audio support. This is why, for instance, Roon and other players downmix Atmos to 5.1.2 (8 channels) for output. Traditional pipelines simply have no concept of “objects” – they operate on fixed channel layouts.

**Consequence:** The result is that a DIY enthusiast using an HTPC with software decoding is effectively getting an **inferior Atmos experience** on headphones: roughly a 7.1 surround mix with some generic height cues. This may be 80-90% of the experience, but it falls short of what true object-based rendering (like Dolby’s own headphone renderer or the Smyth Realiser A16) can achieve – especially in scenes with significant overhead action or object panning (e.g. helicopter flyovers, rain, voices moving overhead, etc.).

## Atmos Metadata Extraction: Feasibility and Tools

**Proprietary Nature of Atmos:** Dolby Atmos in its full glory is proprietary. The object audio is encoded within TrueHD or Dolby Digital Plus bitstreams as additional data that typical decoders (e.g. ffmpeg/LAV) either ignore or cannot interpret. Dolby’s algorithms for encoding/decoding Atmos are closed-source and require licensing. Until recently, **no publicly available tool** could extract the object metadata from a TrueHD+Atmos track on PC – only the 7.1 bed was accessible. (In fact, ffmpeg’s documentation explicitly notes a `truehd_core` filter to **drop Atmos data** and extract only the 7.1 core, implying it doesn’t utilize the objects.)

**Breakthrough – Open Source Atmos Decoders:** In the past couple of years, community developers have made progress in **reverse-engineering Atmos decoding**. Notably, a developer known as *VoidX* undertook the monumental task of reading the Dolby Atmos specifications (a **\~550-page document**) and implemented a decoder in open source. The result is a project called **Cavern**, which is the first software to decode Atmos object tracks on PC outside of Dolby’s official tools. Cavern initially focused on **Dolby Digital Plus Atmos** (the lossy Atmos used in streaming services), and it successfully decodes the joint-object coding (JOC) data in those streams. As of mid-2025, Cavern has been **announced to support Dolby TrueHD+Atmos (lossless)** as well. This means for **local Blu-ray rips**, an open-source path to full Atmos decoding is finally available.

* *Cavern highlights:* It’s an object-based audio engine and conversion tool (written in C# .NET, open-source under MIT license). Using a utility called **Cavernize**, you can input an Atmos audio file (E-AC-3+Atmos `.ec3`, or TrueHD+Atmos `.thd`) and it will output audio with all objects rendered or preserved. Currently, Cavern works as an **offline file converter** rather than a real-time decoder – you convert the track to another format first. It supports output to arbitrary channel layouts or even a custom “Spatial” audio file format. In essence, Cavern can take an Atmos track and give you either a **multi-channel WAV** (with more than 8 channels if you choose) or even an **ADM BWF** file (Audio Definition Model, which holds object metadata). The project also includes an object audio renderer and even rudimentary HRTF support (more on that later).

* *Status of TrueHD support:* As of the latest reports, VoidX (Cavern’s author) announced that **TrueHD Atmos decoding** was working in development and expected to be released (circa August 2025). This is significant – previously, PC decoding of lossless Atmos was thought impossible without Dolby’s secret sauce. Cavern’s advancement suggests that the TrueHD Atmos binary structure has been understood well enough to extract objects. (This likely involved deciphering how objects are embedded in TrueHD frames – potentially via additional substreams or markers that Dolby uses for home Atmos.) The **Atmos metadata** itself contains each object’s audio waveform plus its time-varying 3D position (x, y, z coordinates relative to the room/speakers) and other parameters (like size or divergence, which spreads an object over multiple speakers). Cavern is able to parse this metadata and make the object audio usable.

**Existing community tools:** Aside from Cavern, there have been a few other efforts or tools to get at Atmos content, mostly leveraging Dolby’s own software in creative ways:

* **Music Media Helper (MMH):** This is a third-party GUI tool often used by home theater enthusiasts. A recent beta of MMH added an “Atmos Helper” which can *invoke Dolby’s official decoders* behind the scenes. By using Dolby’s professional **Reference Player** (a licensed tool normally for studios) – if one somehow obtains it – MMH can convert a TrueHD+Atmos track into **multiple WAV files or an ADM file**. For example, users have reported decoding a TrueHD Atmos track into a **16-channel WAV** (presumably 9.1.6 layout) using MMH. MMH can also output a `.atmos` master file or an ADM BWF, which can be imported into audio workstations like DaVinci Resolve’s Fairlight or Pro Tools for further manipulation. **However**, this route requires Dolby’s software (the Reference Decoder and Atmos Renderer), which is not freely available – it typically requires a paid license (often available only to studios or via a Dolby developer program). So while it demonstrates *technical feasibility*, it’s not a legal DIY solution for most users.

* **MakeMKV/ebur128 method:** Some have extracted the audio and tried creative hacks like using multiple simultaneous decodes or subtracting cores, but these don’t truly get object data – they just ensure all channels (like 7.1.4) are accounted for if present. (For instance, TrueHD has a feature of embedding a 5.1 or 7.1 core and additional extensions; some methods ensure the 7.1.4 bed is fully extracted, but still that’s not objects.)

**Streaming Atmos:** The Atmos from streaming (Netflix, Disney+, etc.) comes as Dolby Digital Plus with Atmos (E-AC-3 JOC). Cavern *already handles* these streams well. So for any **downloaded or captured streaming files** with an Atmos track, you can use Cavern today to decode them into an object-preserving multichannel file. The limitation is that streaming tracks are compressed (lossy), and also the number of objects used might be fewer due to bandwidth constraints – but the process is the same. You would need to have a way to obtain the raw streaming audio (some people use capture methods or find the demuxed `.ec3` files). Once you have it, Cavern can convert an E-AC-3 Atmos to (for example) a 7.1.4 FLAC or 5.1.2 FLAC, etc., with much better spatial fidelity than just the 5.1 core audio.

**Summary:** It **is feasible** to extract Atmos object metadata on a PC now, but it requires specialized tools. The open-source Cavern project is leading the way for enthusiasts. In absence of that, the only other route involves Dolby’s own software (which is impractical for most). The binary structure of Atmos in TrueHD, in short, consists of additional data frames muxed with the TrueHD bitstream carrying object coordinates and audio. This structure wasn’t documented publicly, but reverse-engineers have figured it out enough to implement decoders. The fact that VoidX accomplished this by studying the spec and writing a decoder from scratch is a testament to the feasibility (with a lot of work).

*To directly answer the question:* **Yes**, Atmos object metadata can be extracted on Windows (or any OS) using reverse-engineered tools. **Projects exist** – Cavern being the primary one – that attempt Atmos extraction. And the **binary format** of home Atmos (in TrueHD) has been deciphered to a large extent by a few experts, even though Dolby keeps it closed. This opens the door to DIY object-based processing.

## Bypassing Channel-Based Pipelines (DirectShow and Windows Limitations)

Given that standard DirectShow-based players (Kodi, MPC-HC with LAV, etc.) only output beds, we need to **bypass the traditional pipeline** to preserve objects. There are a few approaches:

* **Use an External Decoder:** Instead of letting LAV Filters decode the audio, have the player or workflow send the **raw Atmos bitstream** to an external decoder that can handle objects. For example, one could configure Kodi/LAV to bitstream the audio (pass-through) to a virtual device or plugin, then intercept it and decode with Cavern. In practice, this might require writing a custom **DirectShow filter** or using a plugin architecture. Since Cavern’s “Cavernize” is a standalone converter, one offline approach is to pre-decode the track (as described above) and then play it; but for real-time, a custom filter would be needed. Writing a DirectShow filter that calls Cavern libraries to decode TrueHD in software is theoretically possible (Cavern is open source, so a savvy developer could wrap it in a filter). However, this is non-trivial and no such filter currently exists publicly.

* **Alternative Media Frameworks:** DirectShow isn’t the only game in town. **FFmpeg** is the underlying library for many decoders, and one could imagine integrating Cavern’s codec into ffmpeg or GStreamer. So far, ffmpeg’s native support for Atmos is limited to the 7.1 core (it treats the extra Atmos data as unknown extensions). But a fork of ffmpeg or an external **ffmpeg filter** could use Cavern (or similar logic) to output more channels. GStreamer similarly could support a plugin. These would bypass DirectShow completely by using a different playback engine. For instance, one could create a GStreamer pipeline that reads a file, uses a Cavern-based decoder element, and then outputs audio to an ALSA or WASAPI sink. This requires coding, but it sidesteps the 8-channel limitation since you could define a custom audio sink with more channels or directly output stereo after HRTF (thus avoiding needing a multichannel device).

* **Windows Spatial Audio API:** Microsoft’s Windows 10+ introduced a **Spatial Audio API** (part of WASAPI) which allows object-based audio streams. This is how apps output Atmos to devices or to Dolby Access. Essentially, an application can create an **IAudioClient3** with an “immersive” audio stream, and feed audio objects (with position metadata) into the Windows audio engine. The Windows audio service then uses a **Spatial Sound plugin** – e.g. *Dolby Atmos for Headphones*, *Dolby Atmos for Home Theater (AVR)*, *DTS Headphone\:X*, or *Windows Sonic* – to render those objects to the actual output. In theory, one *could* leverage this API for a DIY solution: you’d act as the audio renderer, taking the decoded objects and handing them to the OS along with their coordinates. The big catch is **custom HRTF**: if you use Dolby’s or Sonic’s pipeline, you’re stuck with their HRTF implementations (Dolby and Sonic both use generic HRTFs). There’s no official way to plug your own HRTFs into the Windows spatial sound pipeline (those are proprietary DLLs). So while this API could get around the 8-channel limit (it can natively handle 128 object streams), it doesn’t fulfill the personalized HRTF requirement. Another limitation is that writing an app to do this in real time is complex, though not impossible – it essentially means re-implementing a mini Atmos receiver.

* **ASIO or Multi-Channel Workarounds:** ASIO drivers (and solutions like Voicemeeter with ASIO) can carry more channels than Windows default. For example, professional audio interfaces (e.g. a 16-channel DAC) with ASIO could present 16 channels to a software like Equalizer APO or a DAW. One could imagine decoding Atmos to, say, 12 channels (7.1.4) and sending those 12 channels through an ASIO device loopback into a processing software. In fact, some enthusiasts have done things like use multiple audio devices to get more outputs (there are reports of people outputting 10+ channel PCM from PC by aggregating devices or using ASIO). However, this is quite kludgy for our purpose since ultimately we don’t *need* to output 12 physical channels – we want to fold them down to 2 with HRTF. It’s easier to do that internally in software.

* **Linux/Ubuntu Angle:** If we consider Linux for a moment – Linux doesn’t have the 8-channel limitation in the same way. You can create a multichannel ALSA device or use JACK to handle dozens of channels. There are open-source decoders for Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3) and TrueHD in ffmpeg – those could possibly be extended with Cavern’s code on Linux. In fact, Cavern’s core library being in C# might run on .NET Core on Linux, or the author could port the critical parts to C++. Additionally, the open ADM tools (like **libadm** and **libear**, discussed below) are all usable on Linux. So one could do the heavy lifting (decode and render) on a Linux machine and then just send a stereo result to the Windows PC. The user mentioned they have an Ubuntu machine available – this could be used for *offline processing* of Atmos tracks (since real-time might be less convenient). For example, decode the Atmos to an ADM file or multichannel WAV on Ubuntu, then transfer that to Windows for playback. Or even do the HRTF convolution on Ubuntu using something like SoX or FFmpeg with SOFA HRTFs, then send the finished binaural WAV to the Windows HTPC.

In summary, **bypassing DirectShow/Windows** essentially means **don’t rely on the normal player decoders**. Instead, extract the audio stream and handle it with custom software that isn’t limited by 8 channels. At this moment, the realistic approach is *offline decoding* (extract with MakeMKV, process with Cavern, etc.) rather than real-time, because there’s no plug-and-play filter yet. The user’s intuition to consider offline processing is spot on – it simplifies many of the pipeline problems.

## Object-Based Rendering Algorithms (and Recreating Dolby’s Renderer)

Once we *have* the individual objects or at least a higher-channel audio representation, the next challenge is **rendering** those objects to a two-channel binaural output. Dolby’s Atmos **renderer** (in an AVR or in Dolby Access for headphones) takes into account the speaker layout or headphone HRTF and does real-time placement of sounds. Recreating these algorithms involves a combination of known 3D audio techniques and possibly some proprietary tricks:

* **Dolby’s proprietary rendering:** For speakers, Dolby Atmos uses a combination of **vector-base amplitude panning (VBAP)** and other interpolation methods to map objects to arbitrary layouts. For headphones, Dolby applies an HRTF to each object. In fact, Dolby Atmos for Headphones literally performs a **per-object HRTF convolution** in real time – this is why it can create such a precise immersive effect (each object’s sound is filtered as if coming from its unique position). The *metadata* includes information like distance or spread, which Dolby’s renderer might use to modify volume or HRTF (e.g. nearer sounds might be louder or have less high-frequency attenuation, etc.). Some of these details are not public, but the general concept of per-object rendering is well-known in academic and open-source communities.

* **Reverse-engineered or open algorithms:** While Dolby’s exact renderer is closed, the **audio research community** has developed equivalent techniques under the banner of **“object-based audio”** and **“Next Generation Audio (NGA)”**. Notably, the **BBC and EBU** (European Broadcasting Union) created an open standard renderer called the **EAR (EBU ADM Renderer)**. This renderer is defined in ITU-R BS.2127 and is designed to take Audio Definition Model (ADM) metadata (an open format describing objects, similar to Dolby’s metadata) and render to arbitrary speaker layouts. The BBC released a C++ library called **libear** (Apache 2.0 licensed) which implements this object rendering algorithm. Libear can handle channel-based, scene-based (ambisonics), and object-based audio. Essentially, given a description of objects and a target layout, it computes the gain matrix to send each object to each speaker (using VBAP or other panning for speakers). If the target is headphones, one could integrate an HRTF convolution step instead of simple panning gains.

  * *Academic papers:* There are many papers on VBAP (Vector Base Amplitude Panning) which explain how to take an audio source and distribute it across the three nearest speakers in a layout to image it at a certain 3D position. There are also papers on binaural rendering and individualized HRTFs. The **Reddit r/DSP discussion** you found neatly summarizes: For speakers, it’s mostly amplitude panning (VBAP); for headphones, it’s HRTF convolution. These are well-understood techniques dating back decades. Dolby’s contribution was to create a practical, low-latency engine to do this for up to 128 objects simultaneously and integrate it with metadata.

  * *Open-source implementations:* Besides libear, the EBU also provides **libadm** (for parsing ADM files). There’s also an **ITU reference implementation** of the ADM renderer in Python (good for experimentation, not real-time). Another interesting open project is the **EBU’s libaudioverse or libspatial** – and even game audio libraries (like Google’s **Resonance Audio**, or Facebook’s **Audio360** used in VR) which do per-object HRTF rendering for game engines. These tend to be focused on real-time but often assume the audio is already separate sources (which in our case, after decoding, it would be).

* **Have Dolby’s algorithms been reverse-engineered?** In the strict sense of reproducing Dolby’s exact curves and methods, not entirely in public. But as described, we *don’t need Dolby’s secret sauce* because the core problem (placing sounds in 3D) has known solutions. The main reason no one did this for Atmos until now was the **lack of access to the object audio**. Now that projects like Cavern unlock the objects, existing open-source renderers can be employed. For instance, one could convert the Atmos stream into an **ADM file** (which is basically a JSON/XML describing objects with their audio) and then feed that into libear to render to, say, a 7.1.4 layout or even to 2.0 with binaural filtering. In fact, a user on a forum described a workflow: using Music Media Helper to get a `.atmos` master and then export an ADM BWF, which can be loaded into a DAW supporting ADM (like Pro Tools Ultimate) for further rendering.

* **Implementing simplified object rendering:** For the DIY approach, we can take a **straightforward route for headphones**: treat each Atmos object or channel as a separate sound source and convolve it with a Head-Related Transfer Function filter corresponding to its direction. Sum all these convolved signals, and you have a binaural mix. This is effectively what Dolby does in their headphone renderer (with a generic HRTF). We want to do the same with a *personalized HRTF*. The personalized HRTF can come from measurements (like the user’s own HRTF measured via in-ear mics) or from a synthesized profile. In practice, implementing this means knowing the azimuth/elevation of each object or channel and picking the correct left-ear and right-ear impulse responses.

  * If we have the **exact object positions** from metadata, we could even interpolate between HRTF directions if needed for finer positioning. However, if we choose an output layout (say 7.1.4 channels), we might instead treat those 12 channels as “virtual speakers” with fixed positions (e.g., 30° intervals around plus 4 overhead positions) and convolve each channel with the HRTF for that speaker position. This is a bit less precise (since objects between those speakers won’t be individually addressed), but it’s far easier and still yields a huge improvement over 7.1. **Example:** If we decode to a standard 7.1.4 bed, we’ll have: Front L, C, R, Side L, Side R, Back L, Back R, LFE, Top Front L, Top Front R, Top Rear L, Top Rear R. We can convolve each of those 11 non-LFE channels with HRTF filters corresponding to those directions. The resulting binaural will let us hear sounds above (since the top channels have an appropriate HRTF with elevation) and even distinguish front-vs-back overhead (since top front vs top rear have different cues). This already beats the “height collapsed to two channels” scenario. It’s not full per-object accuracy (if an object was supposed to pan continuously from front-top to back-top, a bed would just send some to TFL then some to TBL abruptly), but it’s a reasonable approximation if objects aren’t moving too fast.

  * If we wanted *full object rendering*, we’d need to actually process each object track separately. Cavern, for instance, could expose each object’s audio and coordinates frame-by-frame – but merging that into a custom renderer in real time would be complex. A more practical approach is what we described: decode into many discrete static channels (like a dense speaker layout) and then virtualize those channels. That essentially uses “virtual speakers” as proxies for objects.

**Bottom line:** We **can** implement object rendering on headphones by leveraging known techniques (VBAP, HRTF). Open-source projects like **libear** provide a foundation for speaker layouts, and could potentially be extended to headphones by integrating an HRTF library (e.g., applying convolution instead of just gain panning). There are also **game audio engines** (like FMOD, Wwise, or OpenAL Soft) that do real-time HRTF for multiple sources – theoretically one could feed the decoded object audio into such an engine to handle the spatialization. For instance, OpenAL Soft allows custom SOFA HRTFs and can render many 3D sources over headphones; if one wrote a small program using OpenAL, it could take object audio streams and position them accordingly.

So while Dolby’s exact methods might have nuances, the *concept* of object rendering has effectively been “open-sourced” through standards (ITU ADM) and implementations (libear, etc.). This means a DIY enthusiast is not blocked by theory – it’s mainly the engineering effort to connect the pieces.

## Windows Audio API Alternatives

The standard Windows audio path isn’t suited for >8 channel or object audio, but Microsoft has provided some alternatives:

* **Windows Spatial Sound (Windows Sonic / Dolby Atmos)** – as mentioned, this is an endpoint for object audio. If one were building a **Windows app** to do this, you could use the **Spatial Audio APIs** to create an object-based audio client. That would handle a lot of heavy lifting (HRTF convolution using either Microsoft’s or Dolby’s engine). However, using Dolby’s renderer via this API requires the user to have Dolby Access installed and set as the active spatial sound provider. Even then, *feeding it raw Atmos bitstream is not possible* – you would have to decode the bitstream yourself and then create individual **SpatialAudioObject** instances for each audio object, set their position (via ISpatialAudioObject::SetPosition), and continually feed their PCM data. It’s essentially building your own Atmos-to-spatial bridge. This is an interesting theoretical project but quite complex and still would use **Dolby’s HRTF (or Microsoft’s)** rather than a personal one. It also wouldn’t easily sync with video unless integrated into a media player.

* **ASIO and Virtual Audio Devices:** To get around the channel limit for something like APL Virtuoso, one might use an **ASIO driver** or a virtual audio cable that supports more channels. For example, tools like **Voicemeeter** can present a multi-channel interface. The user’s current chain uses Voicemeeter Banana (which is 8 channels max). There is Voicemeeter Potato which can handle more channels (up to 8 channels per bus, though). Alternatively, one could use something like **Reaper DAW** as a host: Reaper can take a multichannel audio file (even 16 channel) and output via ASIO to your DAC (downmixing or using multiple stereo pairs, etc.). If Virtuoso is a VST plugin, one could host it in Reaper and feed it a 12-channel bus. This is more of a software integration approach than an API, but it leverages pro-audio capabilities on Windows that bypass the normal limitations.

* **Linux or External Processing:** As the user indicated openness to Linux, it’s worth noting that on Linux you could use something like **CamillaDSP** (an open-source audio DSP engine) which supports convolution and arbitrary routing. CamillaDSP could be configured to take a multichannel input file/stream, apply convolution filters for each channel (HRTFs), and produce stereo out. While CamillaDSP is often used for real-time filtering, one could use it in a pipeline with JACK for live processing (if one managed to live-decode the Atmos to channels). Or simply use it offline to process a multichannel WAV to binaural WAV. The advantage of Linux here is flexibility and scripting – for example, a script could automate using ffmpeg or Cavern to decode audio, then a convolution engine to binauralize it. Since the final playback is on Windows, you’d just bring the finished stereo back.

In essence, **Windows’ own support for >8 channels is limited**, but we have workarounds: use professional audio pipelines (ASIO/DAW) or bypass Windows entirely for the decoding stage. One interesting idea is using **Dolby’s Home Theater (for AVRs)** capability: if one had an AVR that exposes itself as a 7.1.4 USB audio device (some pro processors might, though Anthem AVM70 does not), Windows could send 12 channels to it. This doesn’t really solve headphone output, but underscores that Windows can’t do >8 natively without treating it as Atmos bitstream.

For our purposes, since ultimately we need only stereo out, a pragmatic approach is **do all heavy lifting in software and output stereo** – stereo will go through Windows without issues. We avoid asking Windows to handle 12 separate channels at once, aside from maybe within a single application like a VST host.

## Hybrid Approaches and Workarounds

Considering the complexity, it’s worth brainstorming **hybrid approaches** or partial solutions in case full object-based decoding/rendering is too difficult:

* **Pre-rendered “virtual speaker” mix:** As mentioned, one strategy is to decode Atmos into a **higher-order channel mix** that captures more spatial detail than 7.1. For instance, decoding to **7.1.4 (or 7.1.6)** if possible. With tools like the Dolby Reference Player or possibly Cavern, one could obtain a 12-channel (or 14-channel) PCM WAV file from an Atmos track. If you have a 7.1.4 file, you can then use existing binaural tools to virtualize it. *Example:* APL Virtuoso v2 supports custom layouts with height. If you measured your HRTF with, say, a 7.1.4 speaker setup (using Impulcifer or similar), Virtuoso can take a 7.1.4 input and output binaural audio using your personal HRTF. This would **bypass the 8-channel Windows limit** by likely using ASIO or a multichannel workaround, but at least it leverages an already-polished binaural engine (Virtuoso) for the personalization aspect. This hybrid approach gives you much of the benefit: discrete front/back height and perhaps width of sound, albeit still not *individual moving objects* if they exceed the speaker count. Many Atmos soundtracks, however, don’t use anywhere near 118 simultaneous objects – they often use a few dynamic objects and ambient bed channels. So a 7.1.4 mix can actually be very close to the artistic intent for many scenes (indeed Dolby’s home Atmos is often authored as 7.1.4 bed plus occasional extra objects).

* **External hardware decoding + software HRTF:** This is a bit “out there,” but one could use a hardware device to decode Atmos and feed into a PC for binauralization. For example, the user’s Anthem AVM70 is a high-end processor that can decode Atmos to its analog outputs (up to 15 channels). In theory, you could play the movie on the HTPC *bitstreaming* Atmos via HDMI to the AVM70, let the Anthem decode the full object audio to its 15 channel analog output, then capture those analog signals with a multi-channel audio interface into a PC for live HRTF processing. This would give you all the benefits of a proper Atmos decode (the Anthem’s internal renderer would output the correct signals for each speaker). However, this approach is **impractical** for a few reasons: (1) You’d need an audio interface with 12-16 analog inputs to capture all channels, introducing D/A and A/D conversions (quality loss and latency); (2) synchronization would be challenging; (3) it’s a Rube Goldberg setup overall. It’s mentioned here mostly to illustrate that it’s technically possible, but it defeats the “DIY low-cost” spirit (and approaches the complexity of just buying a Smyth A16 or similar, which does this internally).

* **Use of Ambisonics:** Another approach sometimes considered in spatial audio is converting object-based audio to an **ambisonic** soundfield, then decoding that to binaural. Ambisonics is a way to represent a 3D sound scene independent of speakers, and there are many tools to go from ambisonics to binaural with custom HRTFs. If one could convert the Atmos mix to a High Order Ambisonics (HOA) format (for example, third-order ambisonics has 16 channels, which can encode a full 3D scene), then one could use something like the Google Resonance or Facebook 360 decoder to binauralize. This is quite convoluted and not necessarily better, but I mention it as a theoretical: ADM (Audio Definition Model) can describe scenes that could be rendered via ambisonic intermediate or direct. In practice, sticking to discrete channels (like 7.1.4) is easier for a DIY project.

* **Fallback to Dolby Headphone/Sonic:** If all else fails and one cannot get a custom object processing working, the user could always use the Windows built-in spatial solutions as a *stopgap*. For example, **Dolby Atmos for Headphones** (via Dolby Access) will take the Atmos bitstream from many PC apps (e.g. the Movies & TV app, or Tidal, etc.) and render it to generic binaural. This at least gives the full object experience (in a non-personalized way). The user clearly is dissatisfied with generic HRTFs (rightly so, since they can be hit-or-miss depending on the person). Windows Sonic is a free alternative that also does object headphone rendering generically. These don’t meet the personalized criterion, but I mention them because they illustrate what we’re aiming to replicate with personal HRTFs. (Interesting note: Dolby has been experimenting with personalized HRTFs in their own ecosystem – they even announced a personalized HRTF beta where you can measure your ears via an app and upload to Dolby Access, but as of mid-2025 they have *removed* that feature, possibly to refine it for future use.)

The **preferred approach**, based on everything above, is: **Use Cavern (or similar) to get as many discrete channels out of the Atmos track as possible, then apply personalized HRTF to those channels.** This maximizes spatial info while leveraging the existing personalized virtualizer (Virtuoso or a custom convolution setup). It’s a stepping stone toward full per-object rendering, and as tools improve, one can iterate.

## Legal and Licensing Considerations

Before implementing any Atmos decoding solution, it’s important to acknowledge the **legal side**:

* **Dolby’s IP:** Dolby Atmos encoding/decoding is protected by intellectual property rights. The TrueHD codec and Dolby Digital Plus JOC are patented technologies. Writing your own decoder potentially **infringes patents** if used in countries where those patents are active. Open-source projects tread a fine line here: they typically avoid using any leaked source code or confidential info (to avoid trade secret violations), but even a clean-room implementation can still violate patents (which cover the *method*). Dolby’s patent on Dolby Digital Plus (AC-3) has started to expire (the core AC-3 is older), but the Atmos extensions and TrueHD may still be under patent.

* **Reverse Engineering EULA:** If one obtains Dolby’s spec or SDK under an agreement, they usually forbid writing an independent decoder. VoidX likely did not have an official SDK (or he wouldn’t be allowed to release code), so he must have used publicly available information and his own analysis. This is generally legal in many jurisdictions (reverse engineering for interoperability or for research), but distributing the resulting software can attract attention. So far, Dolby has not publicly acted against Cavern – possibly because it’s a niche enthusiast project and not used commercially.

* **Personal Use vs Distribution:** For an end-user doing this privately on their own files, the risk is extremely low. You are entitled to process audio you have in any way you see fit. The legal issues are more for someone distributing a tool or solution. Since the question is about a DIY setup, we can assume it’s for personal use on legally obtained content (e.g., Blu-ray rips that the user owns). In that case, using an open-source decoder like Cavern is similar to using libdvdcss for DVDs – a gray area, but largely tolerated for individual use.

* **GPL/Licensing of Tools:** Cavern is MIT-licensed, which means it can be used freely, but if one were to integrate it into another software, that’s allowed without copyleft concerns. The BBC’s libear is Apache 2.0, also very permissive. No issues there. Just avoid mixing any code that might be legally encumbered (e.g., using the actual Dolby binaries without a license, which MMH requires the user to have a Dolby developer license file – something not freely obtainable).

* **Patent timeline:** It might be worth noting that by the time patents expire (which could be 5-10 years from now for newer Atmos tech), these concerns fade and open implementations may even get integrated into mainstream ffmpeg, etc. But as of 2025, we’re still within the window of Dolby’s control.

In short, **reverse-engineering Atmos is somewhat legally sensitive**, but for a DIY enthusiast, the practical risk is minimal. Just be aware that any software you use is technically unlicensed by Dolby. (If one wanted to be 100% legal and licensed, the only option would be to purchase something like the Dolby Atmos Production Suite or hardware that includes a decoder – which is exactly what we’re trying to avoid due to cost.)

## Performance Requirements for Real-Time Object Processing

**Computational Load:** Full object-based binaural rendering is computationally heavy, though not impossibly so with modern hardware:

* *Objects decoding:* Decoding the TrueHD/Atmos bitstream itself is somewhat CPU intensive (TrueHD is lossless and complex, plus extracting objects). Cavern’s decoder is optimized in C#/C++, but doing it in real time for high-bitrate audio may use a significant CPU percentage, especially if not multi-threaded. TrueHD bitrates can be 4-8 Mbps for Atmos, and the decoder has to unpack potentially 16+ channels of data.

* *HRTF convolution:* The biggest load is convolving potentially dozens of audio streams with HRTF filters. A typical HRTF impulse response might be \~200 taps (a few milliseconds). Convolving 100 objects x 2 ears x 200 taps = 40,000 convolution operations per audio sample. At 48 kHz, that’s 1.92 billion multiply-adds per second, which is beyond what a single CPU core can handle. The good news is in practice, **not all 118 objects are active at full range**. Most scenes might have, say, 10-30 active objects and many are low-level or ambient. Also, many objects could be small sounds where a shorter filter or approximation might be acceptable.

* *Optimizations:* We can use partitioned FFT convolution to greatly reduce the cost if latency can be slightly increased. We can also vectorize (SIMD) the convolution. Modern CPUs with AVX can do 8-16 multiplies in one instruction. Also, if objects are static or share the same HRTF (like if we render to virtual speakers), then we only convolve each channel once, not each object. For instance, in the **7.1.4 virtual speaker** approach, it’s just 12 channels \* 2 ears to convolve = 24 convolutions, which is trivial for a modern CPU with FFT methods (a few % CPU). So the *channel-based intermediate* approach is not only simpler, but far less CPU than doing 100 separate convolutions.

* *Real-time on consumer HTPC:* If one *did* try to convolve every object independently in real time, a high-end CPU (e.g. 12+ core modern desktop CPU) might manage it with optimized code, especially if using adaptive processing (don’t process silent objects, etc.). GPU acceleration is an intriguing idea: convolution can be done via OpenCL/CUDA, or even using graphics APIs (some researchers have used pixel shaders for FIR filtering, treating audio samples as pixels). There’s also the approach of using the GPU’s tensor cores for fast FIR (this is not common, but conceptually possible). However, developing a custom GPU audio pipeline is a project in itself.

* *Memory and I/O:* If we’re doing this in real time alongside video playback, memory bandwidth and thread scheduling become considerations. One has to ensure the audio processing doesn’t fall behind (causing glitches) and remains in sync with video (possibly requiring a consistent buffering scheme).

Given all that, the **offline approach** shines: you can allocate as much CPU time as needed, even process faster than real-time. For example, an Atmos movie could be decoded and binaural-rendered at 2x or 4x speed on a multi-core CPU to generate the output file. If it takes 30 minutes to process a 1-hour audio, that’s fine for an offline workflow.

**Latency:** If a real-time pipeline is eventually achieved, latency will come from two parts – the decoder buffer and the HRTF filter length. A small decoder buffer (e.g. 20-50ms) plus a convolution length of maybe 20ms would add up to \~70ms total latency, which is on the edge of perceptible A/V sync. One can compensate by delaying video or using the player’s audio delay setting. Many AVRs introduce 50-100ms in their processing anyway (room correction, etc.), so it’s not unheard of. For a single PC doing both video and heavy audio processing, ensuring consistent latency might be tricky but doable.

**Multi-threading:** It’s worth noting that object audio rendering is embarrassingly parallel in many ways – each object can be processed on a separate thread/core up to mixdown. So a multi-core CPU can divide the object load. Cavern’s engine is likely multi-threaded (since it touts “ultra low latency” and is designed for real-time upmixing as well). So future real-time versions might take good advantage of modern CPUs. The *Smyth Realiser A16* uses dedicated DSP hardware (two SHARC DSPs) to handle 24 channels of convolution in real time with minimal latency – a PC with a decent CPU/GPU can theoretically match or exceed that given raw power differences.

**Conclusion (performance):** For now, **real-time object binaural on a standard PC is pushing the limits**, but as a pre-processing step or with a powerful system, it’s feasible. For the DIY enthusiast, it means being prepared for high CPU usage or doing things offline. We expect this to improve as open software gets optimized (and as hardware gets faster). The user should be prepared to experiment with settings (e.g., maybe limit to the most important objects if doing live, or use a slightly reduced object count). But if the focus is local media, doing it offline sidesteps performance concerns entirely – you just let the computer churn for a bit, then enjoy perfectly rendered audio during playback.

## Integration with Personalized HRTF Workflow

A key part of the objective is to use **personalized HRTFs** (from the user’s binaural measurements) in the Atmos rendering. Let’s consider how to integrate that:

**Current HRTF Pipeline (Impulcifer → APL Virtuoso):** The user has presumably measured their own head-related impulse responses using in-ear mics and speakers (perhaps through a process like Impulcifer, which produces a set of HRTF filters for various directions). APL’s Virtuoso v2 is being used as the binaural engine with those custom filters. Typically, a workflow might be: feed a multichannel test signal into Virtuoso, which convolves each channel with the corresponding measured IR (yielding a very accurate virtualization of that speaker layout in the user’s ears).

To maintain this personalization in our Atmos setup, we have a few options:

* **Use Virtuoso directly with a richer channel input:** If Virtuoso can accept more than 8 channels input, we could feed it a **wider layout**. For example, if we manage to decode an Atmos movie to a 7.1.4 FLAC file, we could attempt to play that through Foobar2000 or JRiver with the Virtuoso plugin active, or through a VST host that routes audio to Virtuoso. We’d configure Virtuoso’s virtual speaker layout to match the channels (e.g., define the 12 virtual speaker positions exactly where the 7.1.4 channels are supposed to be in space when we did the HRTF measurement). Since the user can perform custom measurements, they could even measure more points (like a full 7.1.4 setup in a room, or use existing speaker positions for heights). If the HRTF measurement wasn’t originally done for height speakers, they might need to measure those to fully benefit. Impulcifer does support measuring height speakers (if you set up speakers above). Assuming that’s done, Virtuoso can then render those 12 channels as if they are coming from real speakers placed in those directions around the user’s head. The result should be extremely close to what an actual 7.1.4 speaker system would produce for that audio – which, while not as ideal as 100 objects, is **a massive improvement** over 7.1 bed (because now overhead sounds can distinctly come from front-top vs back-top, etc.).

  *Practical note:* Getting a media player to output 12 channels might require ASIO. JRiver Media Center, for instance, can handle 12-channel audio and you can use a convolution engine or VST (Virtuoso) on it. Foobar2000 can play multichannel FLAC/WAV too (up to 16ch), and if Virtuoso is available as a component or if you use a VST wrapper, it might work. This might involve some trial-and-error. In worst case, one could use a DAW like Reaper: put the 12-channel audio on a track, insert Virtuoso as FX, and play it synced to the video (Reaper can play video in its timeline). This is admittedly clunky for regular use but could be done as a demo.

* **Manual Convolution Approach:** If not using Virtuoso live, one can always do an **offline convolution**. For example, suppose you have a set of HRIRs from Impulcifer for each speaker in a 7.1.4 layout. You could set up a project in Reaper (or a Python script using scipy signal convolve) that reads the 12-channel audio, convolves each channel with the corresponding left-ear and right-ear impulse responses, and mixes the results. This would yield two channels (left ear sum and right ear sum). You’d then have a final stereo WAV that is exactly what Virtuoso would produce if it virtualized those speakers. This is effectively doing what Virtuoso does, but “freezing” it into a file. The advantage: you can ensure sample-accurate convolution and possibly even use longer impulses (Virtuoso might truncate or use IIR filters, not sure). The downside: it’s offline, and you’d have to do this for each piece of content. But since the user is okay with offline processing, this is a solid method. It’s similar to how some people use **Impulcifer’s convolver** to virtualize content offline.

  There are already enthusiasts doing things like: decode Atmos to 7.1.4, then use a tool to convolve with their own HRTF and get a binaural file. This is somewhat analogous to how **Smyth A16** works internally (except the A16 does it real-time in hardware). We’d just be doing it in software.

* **Maintaining LFE/Bass Management:** One small integration detail – the `.1` LFE channel in 7.1.4 typically isn’t meant to be directly sent to headphones (since it’s low freq effects). In a binaural render, usually the LFE is mixed into both ears (perhaps with a generic HRTF at low frequency, which is mostly non-directional). The Virtuoso or custom conv approach should handle this by either ignoring HRTF (since <80Hz sound is non-localizable) or by having included the sub in the measurement (some people do measure a sub response or they route it into the main channels). This is a minor detail but worth noting. We can simply mix the LFE equally into left and right after applying some house curve if needed. The Cavern tool or Dolby decoder might already merge LFE appropriately when rendering to headphones (Dolby often applies some bass management).

* **Latency in chain:** If we do try to do this in real time (e.g., playing a movie while convolving on the fly), we need to buffer. Tools like EqualizerAPO with convolution would add maybe \~50ms latency. Virtuoso likely adds a similar amount. Many media players allow an audio delay offset to resync if needed. If offline, latency doesn’t matter except to ensure alignment when remuxing the audio (but if you process the entire track offline, you’d keep the same length, so it stays in sync with video if replaced in the container).

**Integration with existing software:** Ideally, the process could become: *MakeMKV (rip) → Cavernize (decode to multichannel) → \[maybe manual editing to flac] → Foobar/JRiver + Virtuoso (playback).* Or *Cavernize → Convolve to binaural WAV → replace original audio track → play in Kodi as normal (just playing a 2.0 FLAC which is already binaural).* The latter is attractive: you could even **mux the binaural track into the MKV** and label it “Headphone Atmos (binaural)” and just switch to it when listening on headphones, while still retaining the original 7.1 track for speaker use. This way the HTPC doesn’t have to do anything special during playback; all the heavy lifting was done beforehand. This is similar to how some Blu-rays now include a Dolby Atmos *Binaural* track (rare, but perhaps coming in future).

**Maintaining Customization:** A big benefit of doing it ourselves is we are not limited to “generic” HRTF. The user’s measurements via Impulcifer, etc., capture not only ear shape but also some room cues if they measured in a room. This tends to produce a very realistic virtualization for that specific setup. Our approach will preserve that, effectively creating a **personalized virtual home theater** in their headphones. Reviews on Audio Science Review have noted that without personal HRTF, headphone Atmos is a mixed bag – some people get great results, others find it unnatural. By integrating the user’s own HRTF (the “Holy Grail” of spatial audio), we ensure the most accurate localization for *them*.

**Potential Challenges:** Integrating all this isn’t plug-and-play. The user will have to be somewhat comfortable with command-line tools or audio software. There might be troubleshooting – e.g., channel order mismatches (ensure the convolution filters apply to the correct channels from Cavern’s output; mapping of channels must be consistent). Also, one must ensure that levels are managed (Atmos tracks have a lot of dynamic range; adding convolution shouldn’t clip – likely need to allow headroom).

**Testing:** It would be wise to test on short clips. For instance, take a demo clip from a Dolby Atmos trailer (which you know well), run it through this pipeline, and compare the headphone result with what Dolby Access produces (for reference) or with what a simpler 7.1 mix gives. Listen for improvements in overhead localization, etc. This will validate the approach before processing dozens of full movies.

## Implementation Roadmap (Step-by-Step)

Bringing it all together, here’s a practical roadmap for the most promising DIY approach – focusing on **local Blu-ray rips with offline processing**, as that seems to have the highest chance of success:

1. **Extract the Audio Track:** Use MakeMKV or similar to rip your Blu-ray to an MKV file with the **Dolby TrueHD+Atmos** audio track intact. Then, using a tool like `mkvextract` or ffmpeg, demux the audio track to a separate file (e.g., `movie.thd` for TrueHD or `movie.eac3` for DD+). This file will contain the Atmos metadata embedded. *(For streaming sources, you’d instead obtain the E-AC-3 Atmos file – there are tools that can grab the raw .ec3 from certain streaming services, or one could capture the HDMI bitstream – but that’s a separate topic.)*

2. **Decode with Cavern (Cavernize):** Run the Cavern tool on the extracted audio. For example, Cavernize can be used via command-line. You will specify an output format. Initially, you might choose something like **ADM BWF** or a high-channel-count WAV. If TrueHD support is freshly released, documentation will show how to use it. For DD+ .ec3, Cavern already can output a multichannel WAV up to the full object count (but typically you limit to a certain layout). You might do: `Cavernize.exe input.thd output.wav --layout 7.1.4` (this is a hypothetical syntax) to mix the objects into a 7.1.4 bed output. Alternatively, you might output to **Cavern’s custom “Limitless Audio Format” (LAF)** which can carry all objects and then use another tool to render that. But keeping it simple, output a WAV with, say, 12 or 16 channels. Cavern’s documentation suggests it *can* preserve objects in a custom format or render to channel-based formats. If possible, one strategy is to output **14 channels (9.1.4)** which includes 5 ear-level pairs (Front, Wide, Surround, Back, plus Center) and 4 overheads. 9.1.4 is the maximum bed for home Atmos (if we include front wides), totaling 14 channels. Some Atmos mixes actually utilize wides if played on a system that has them (e.g., 9.1.6 layout on Trinnov). Even if your HRTF wasn’t measured for wides, you could merge those into surrounds perhaps. But 7.1.4 is likely sufficient and simpler.

   * *Note:* If Cavern’s TrueHD support is new, it might initially only output to its own format or a fixed huge waveform (like 16 channels with many empties). In the **AVForums post** it was mentioned that the initial TrueHD support will still be offline conversion, and a real-time version is later. So presumably it outputs a PCM file. We may need to experiment a bit with channel ordering that Cavern uses (it will presumably document it – e.g., it might output L R C LFE Ls Rs Lb Rb TFL TFR TBL TBR for 7.1.4).

3. **Post-process (if needed):** If Cavern outputs an ADM or separate objects, an extra step would be needed to convert that to a multichannel wav. But likely we choose a direct WAV export. If the output is WAV but in an unusual channel order or count (say 16ch with many silent channels), we can use an audio editor or ffmpeg to reorder or trim channels. For example, if we got a 16-channel WAV, we might trim it to 12 channels if the last 4 are empty. This is where knowing the content helps (we can identify which channels carry signal by looking at channel RMS levels).

4. **Apply HRTF Convolution:** Now take the multichannel audio and apply the personalized HRTF filters. If using **APL Virtuoso in real-time**, you would load the multichannel file into a player that can route through Virtuoso. If doing it offline:

   * One method: Use **ffmpeg’s afir filter** or SOFAlizer. If your HRTFs can be saved as a SOFA file with corresponding directions, ffmpeg has a filter `afir` for convolution or `SOFAlizer` for applying a SOFA HRTF to multichannel input. For instance, `ffmpeg -i input.wav -filter_complex "sofalizer=sofa=MyHRTF.sofa:type=nearest:gain=1" -ac 2 output.wav` could take a multichannel input and produce 2-channel binaural (the SOFAlizer filter downmixes an N-channel to binaural using the HRTF data). However, ffmpeg’s SOFAlizer by default assumes a standard speaker layout (like 5.1 or 7.1). I’m not sure it natively supports 7.1.4 yet, and it might not know what to do with 12 channels (there is work in MPEG-H and others for 7.1.4 SOFA conventions). This might not be straightforward unless we craft a custom config.
   * Another method: **DAW approach** – Import the 12-channel WAV into a digital audio workstation (Reaper, etc.). Create 12 mono tracks (or one multichannel track with routing) and insert convolution plugins on each. Use the impulse responses measured from your setup: e.g., “FrontLeft\_Lear.wav” and “FrontLeftRear.wav” etc. Apply each IR to the respective channel (left-ear IR on one copy of the signal, right-ear IR on another copy). There are convolution plugins (LAConvolver, Convology, etc.) or Reaper’s own ReaVerb can do FIR convos. After convolving each channel to stereo, sum all the stereo outputs. This yields the final L/R. This can then be rendered as a WAV file. This is labor-intensive to set up once, but you can save it as a template and reuse for all movies (just swap the source file).
   * If the user has **Impulcifer**, note that Impulcifer actually produces a set of WAV filters and a config for EqualizerAPO to virtualize a given speaker layout. Potentially, one could leverage that: feed the 7.1.4 audio through EqualizerAPO/HeSuVi using the Impulcifer profile. But as the user noted, HeSuVi (which uses EqualizerAPO) doesn’t support true 7.1.4 – it hacks heights as rear channels due to the 8-channel limit. So EqualizerAPO might not accept a 12-channel input from the player. Thus, we might have to wait for a more flexible convolver or use APL’s software.
   * **CamillaDSP** (on Windows or Linux) is another offline option: it can take a multichannel WAV and process via its pipeline (Camilla has a GUI where you can set up convolution filters per channel easily). It might be overkill, but it’s designed for real-time DSP so offline would be fine.

5. **Finalize Binaural Audio:** After convolution, you have a **binaural stereo track** that represents the Atmos audio rendered with your personal HRTF. Ensure the loudness and dynamic range are okay. You likely want to preserve the full dynamic range (Atmos tracks often have 20 dB swings). You might optionally add a little EQ or normalization if needed (some people apply a house curve for headphone bass). But ideally, keep it as is to not alter the mix’s intent.

6. **Playback Options:** Now you can **mux this stereo track back** into your movie file (using mkvmerge, add the WAV/FLAC as a new audio track). Or simply play the stereo file alongside the video (e.g., MPC-HC can load an external audio file for a video). Muxing is cleaner. Tag it as “Atmos Binaural (Personal HRTF)” in the track name for clarity. From here on, **playing it is trivial** – it’s just a 2-channel audio stream that any player or OS can handle. No special real-time processing needed. The binaural effect is already “baked in.” You would listen with your headphones, ideally with any EQ you normally use (if you have a specific EQ for headphone frequency response, you can apply that as well – though if Impulcifer/Virtuoso already took headphone response into account, you might not need additional EQ).

7. **Testing and Iteration:** Compare this binaural result with the original 7.1 downmix through your old pipeline. You should notice more spaciousness and precise placement, especially for height effects. If something is off (e.g., maybe overhead sounds are too diffuse or not loud enough), you might adjust the mix. For instance, maybe the HRTF measurement for overhead was a bit different and you want to tweak the gain on those channels. Or if the LFE feels lacking, you might mix a bit more of it in. These are tweakable in your convolution stage.

8. **Automation:** If you plan to do many files, you could script parts of this. Cavern can be scripted. Perhaps using Python with `pydub` or `scipy` to convolve could be automated. It’s not trivial but definitely possible to make a one-click tool that goes: input Atmos -> output binaural WAV, using pre-defined HRIR filters. The heavy work is obtaining those filters (which you have from Impulcifer) and mapping them to the correct channels. Over time, the community might create such scripts as this practice becomes more common.

This roadmap covers the *“Minimal to Moderate Success”* scenario: you’ll at least get **better-than-7.1** binaural audio. It may not capture every moving object perfectly (since we grouped to speakers), but it will be very close.

If aiming for **“Full Success”** (i.e., matching a \$4000 Smyth A16 object-for-object), the only difference would be doing the convolution per object instead of per channel. Achieving that would require modifying the pipeline so that, for example, instead of summing all objects into the four height channels, you treat them separately if they’re distinct. Cavern’s engine might eventually allow exporting each object’s track, but that could mean dozens of audio files – not practical manually. However, if Cavern’s **API** is accessible, one could theoretically write a program to feed each object’s audio through an HRTF corresponding to its dynamic position. This basically means writing your own renderer. That’s a **big project** (you’d essentially be replicating what libear or Dolby’s renderer does, but adding personalized HRTF). Given the complexity, it’s probably not necessary for a great experience – the difference between full object rendering vs a dense 7.1.4 rendering might be subtle in many cases.

## Risk Analysis and Challenges

It’s important to note the potential risks or challenges in this DIY endeavor:

* **Complexity & Maintenance:** The workflow described is quite involved. Any changes in software (e.g., new versions of Cavern) or differences in movie audio channel mappings could require troubleshooting. This isn’t a polished consumer solution; it’s a custom pipeline that you’ll need to maintain. There may be unexpected issues – for example, certain Atmos tracks might use object metadata in a way that Cavern interprets oddly, or perhaps a bug causes a slight sync drift. Be prepared for some trial and error.

* **Sync Issues:** When remuxing a processed audio track, ensure it lines up exactly with the original. If you start processing from the very first sample of the track, it usually will. Just be cautious about things like initial silence or delays – sometimes Atmos tracks have a brief delay relative to video (for example, to align with video frame boundaries). If you mux in a new audio and find it’s a few ms off, you may need to adjust delay in mkvmerge. It’s easy to do (set an offset), but you’d need to spot it.

* **Storage & Time:** Binaural WAV/FLAC files can be large (though FLAC compresses stereo well). Processing each movie might take dozens of GB temporarily (the intermediate multichannel WAV could be huge – e.g., a 2-hour 12-channel 24-bit 48kHz WAV is \~14 GB). Make sure you have disk space and perhaps clean up intermediates after. The processing time, as noted, could be significant depending on your CPU. If it takes an hour or two per hour of audio, that’s not too bad for occasional use. If it’s slower, you might need to let jobs run overnight. If you eventually accumulate many binaural movies, that’s a lot of preprocessing time invested (but again, still worth it compared to spending \$4000 on hardware – if you value your time accordingly!).

* **Content Compatibility:** Our focus was on **local Blu-ray rips** because that gives the highest quality audio and full access to TrueHD+Atmos. For **streaming** content, it’s a bit trickier: you’d have to obtain the E-AC-3 bitstream (which might involve breaking DRM or capturing the HDMI output which is not straightforward). Some people use devices or software to capture Netflix/Amazon audio to a file. If you do manage to get an Atmos streaming file, the same tools (Cavern) can decode it. The resulting quality will be slightly lower (since DD+ is lossy and usually limited to 48 kHz, 16-bit). But the spatial info is still there. Just note that many streaming Atmos mixes are *different* from disc mixes (often less aggressive, sometimes fewer objects).

* **Future-proofing:** It sounds like by the time one sets all this up, **Cavern or similar might introduce a more automated solution**. For example, if Cavern eventually integrates a real-time audio processor with a GUI that allows custom HRTFs (maybe via SOFA files), that could simplify everything – you’d just use that program to play your movies. VoidX has hinted at a real-time processor in the works, though it “will take a lot longer” to develop. That might be something like a virtual sound driver where you bitstream Atmos into it and it outputs stereo. Keep an eye on that development; it could save effort in the long run. But until then, the manual route we described is the way to go.

* **Legal risk (revisited):** If you share any of the processed content (which you likely wouldn’t, since it’s tailored to your ears), that would obviously be infringing (it’s still the movie audio). But just for personal use, it’s fine. Sharing the *tools or methods* is generally fine too, and actually helps the community. Dolby might not be thrilled with an open Atmos decoder, but they haven’t taken action to stop it publicly. Using it falls under personal fair use of the content you bought, arguably.

* **Expectation management:** While we anticipate a significant improvement, it’s worth noting that **psychoacoustics** can be tricky. Personalized HRTF over headphones can indeed fool you into feeling like you’re in a speaker-filled room – *provided* the HRTFs are accurate and the listener’s brain acclimates to them. Many people (especially on ASR and other forums) have reported that using their own measured HRTF with Atmos content is stunningly effective, often indistinguishable from speakers. But it can vary. If the measurement wasn’t perfect or the content mix is doing something unusual, results may vary. There might be some “dialing in” needed (maybe small EQ tweaks, etc., to match the user’s preference).

* **Alternatives if stuck:** If, despite best efforts, full Atmos decoding is too difficult to automate, one could consider using a **Smyth Realiser A16** as a decoder front-end (the device can decode Atmos and output binaural using your personal measurements). But of course, that’s the expensive commercial route we’re trying to avoid. Another alternative that’s a bit less expensive is the **Creative SXFI Theater** or similar, which uses personalized HRTF (via photos of your ear/head) to do headphone surround. However, those solutions still only get 7.1 input (they rely on Windows 7.1 or Atmos for Headphones pipeline). They don’t truly decode Atmos objects either – they take the 7.1 from Windows and apply their HRTF. So they don’t solve the core problem of losing object data.

Given all the above, the user’s DIY approach **has a clear path to success** using currently available tools. It aligns with the “moderate success” scenario: significantly better spatial rendering than the status quo, using mostly free software and personal ingenuity, at the cost of some time and complexity. It may not be *quite* as plug-and-play or as perfect as a commercial Atmos headphone renderer like the A16, but it should get very close in performance. And importantly, it retains the **cost advantage** – essentially free (aside from possibly buying a few software like JRiver or using existing tools) versus thousands of dollars.

## Conclusion

**Value Proposition:** By extracting full Atmos object data and applying custom HRTF processing, a DIY enthusiast can achieve a level of spatial audio over headphones that rivals commercial solutions like the Smyth Realiser A16 – all using a regular PC. The current limitation of 8-channel output can be overcome with a combination of **reverse-engineered decoding** and **open-source rendering techniques**. While the process is complex, it is grounded in software that is available *today*. The heavy lifting of decoding Atmos (formerly only in Dolby’s domain) is now possible with community-driven tools like Cavern, and the concepts of object rendering are well documented in academic research.

**Summary of Feasibility:** Technically, nothing in this plan violates the laws of physics or fundamental limitations – it’s mostly software engineering challenges. Legally, one should be cautious but for personal use it’s a non-issue. Performance-wise, offline processing is advisable now, but real-time may become feasible as optimizations are introduced. Integration with the user’s existing personalized HRTF workflow is not only possible but one of the key strengths of this approach (since it achieves what generic solutions cannot: individualized cues).

**Next Steps:** The user can start by experimenting with a short clip (maybe a Dolby Atmos demo file) through the pipeline to validate each stage. From there, it’s a matter of scaling up and perhaps automating parts of it. The roadmap provided gives a guideline, but it can be adjusted as needed. If at any point a step isn’t working (e.g., Cavern’s TrueHD support is delayed or experimental), the user could stick to DD+ Atmos content for testing, or use interim solutions (like decoding the 7.1.4 bed via the Dolby Reference Player if they manage to get it) until the open tools mature.

The excitement here is that we’re at the cusp of hobbyists being able to fully unlock Atmos. In fact, the question and research we’ve gone through highlight that **2025 is the year this became possible** – something confirmed by forum posts celebrating Atmos finally decoded on PC. This means the user is attempting this at the right time, leveraging bleeding-edge developments.

In conclusion, **extracting Atmos object metadata on a Windows HTPC and doing object-based binaural rendering is indeed feasible**, and the user’s willingness to embrace offline processing and even Linux for parts of the workflow makes it even more attainable. By combining tools like Cavern for decoding and custom HRTF convolution for rendering, one can surpass the traditional 8-channel PCM limitation and enjoy a *true* Atmos experience on headphones – with sounds genuinely coming from above, behind, and all around, precisely tailored to the listener’s own ears. This DIY solution exemplifies the power of open research and community tools in bringing cinema-quality experiences to enthusiasts without requiring proprietary hardware. The journey will involve some effort, but the reward is a uniquely immersive audio experience that previously required very expensive equipment.
