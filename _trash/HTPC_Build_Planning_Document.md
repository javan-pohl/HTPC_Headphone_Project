## üåü **Why madVR for This Build**

### **üé® Tone Mapping Excellence - Your Primary Benefit**
**The Problem:** LG C3's built-in tone mapping can cause:
- Banding in gradients (especially HDR content)
- Crushed highlights in bright scenes
- Loss of shadow detail in dark content
- Inconsistent processing between different sources

**madVR's Solution:**
- **Advanced tone mapping algorithms** with customizable curves
- **Better highlight preservation** - retains detail in bright scenes
- **Smooth gradient handling** - eliminates banding artifacts
- **Consistent processing** regardless of content source

### **üîß Additional madVR Benefits**
1. **Professional Upscaling:** NGU algorithms make 1080p ‚Üí 4K look significantly better
2. **Motion Processing:** Superior 24p film handling, eliminates judder
3. **Color Accuracy:** Professional color space conversion and calibration
4. **3D Support:** Frame-packed 3D output for your projector

### **üí° Real-World Impact for You**
Based on your sensitivity to display banding (noticed until JVC NZ7):
- **Immediate improvement** in gradient smoothness
- **Better HDR experience** with preserved highlights  
- **Professional results** matching high-end projectors like your JVC
