# Project Focus Rules
**Purpose**: Keep project on track and avoid getting lost in technical rabbit holes

## ðŸŽ¯ **THE CORE QUESTION**
**Does Atmos decoding (16+ channels) provide significantly better headphone experience than advanced 8-channel binaural processing?**

This is the **ONLY** question that matters. Everything else is implementation details.

## ðŸš¨ **STAY ON TRACK RULES**

### **Rule 1: Two-Option Focus**
- **Option 1**: Keep AVM70 + existing media players (16+ channels)
- **Option 2**: HTPC replacement (8 channels max)
- **No other options** until we answer the core question

### **Rule 2: Testing Before Complexity**
- Don't research complex routing solutions until we know if they're needed
- Test 8-channel binaural processing FIRST
- Only pursue 16+ channel solutions if 8-channel is insufficient

### **Rule 3: Practical Over Perfect**
- Focus on "good enough" rather than theoretical maximums
- Real listening tests over technical specifications
- Working solutions over perfect solutions

### **Rule 4: Question Before Research**
Before researching any technical topic, ask:
- "Does this help answer the core question?"
- "Do we need this information before testing?"
- "Is this a rabbit hole?"

### **Rule 5: Decision Points Not Research Projects**
Each investigation should lead to a clear decision:
- Test this
- Buy that
- Abandon this approach
- Move to next option

## âœ… **CURRENT PRIORITY ORDER**

1. **Install HeSuVi** â†’ Test 8-channel binaural processing quality
2. **Listen to Atmos content** â†’ Evaluate spatial audio effectiveness
3. **Make the decision** â†’ Option 1 vs Option 2
4. **Then** implement chosen solution

## ðŸ›‘ **RABBIT HOLES TO AVOID**

- VoiceMeeter Insert Virtual ASIO research (until we know if we need >8 channels)
- Complex AVM70 routing research (until we know if we're keeping it)
- Alternative media player research (solved - they all have same limitation)
- Expensive binaural processor research (until we test free options)

## ðŸ’¬ **AI ASSISTANT GUIDELINES**

**If user asks about complex technical implementation:**
- Remind about the core question
- Suggest testing current 8-channel setup first
- Only research if directly needed for immediate testing

**If user gets into technical details:**
- "Does this help us answer whether 8-channel binaural processing is good enough?"
- "Should we test the current setup first?"

**Focus on practical next steps, not theoretical solutions.**
